# DynatraceRestAPI

Provide succinct and direct instructions in the main readme to start the server and test the operations.

To start the server, run this command:

python -m http.server

To query operation 1, run this command (which should have the value 5.2768 as the returning information):
curl http://localhost:8888/exchanges/GBP/2023-01-02
Attention will be put on correct behaviour of operations, application structure, and general code quality (readability, naming, etc.).
